| 15  | to those who commit sins that do not lead to death.                       | I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death.                       | τοῖς ἁμαρτάνουσιν μὴ πρὸς θάνατον.                                           |
| 16  | There is sin that leads to death;                                         | There is a sin that leads to death.                                      | ἔστιν ἁμαρτία πρὸς θάνατον·                                                  |
| 17  | I do not say that one should pray for that.                               | I am not saying that you should pray about that.                         | οὐ περὶ ἐκείνης λέγω ἵνα ἐρωτήσῃ.                                            |
| 18  | 17 All wrongdoing is sin,                                                 | 17 All wrongdoing is sin,                                                | 17 πᾶσα ἀδικία ἁμαρτία ἐστίν,                                                |
| 19  | but there is sin that does not lead to death.                             | and there is sin that does not lead to death.                            | καὶ ἔστιν ἁμαρτία οὐ πρὸς θάνατον.                                           |
